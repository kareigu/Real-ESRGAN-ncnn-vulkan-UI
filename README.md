## Installing
Currently requires you to manually download a release of Real-ESRGAN-ncnn-vulkan along with the built models.  
Extracting them next to the executable in a folder called `cli/` allows the frontend to use them.

Eventually the plan is to provide functionality for fetching the files automatically
