## Installing
Download the latest release and extract it in a folder.  
When starting up the first time, you will be asked if you want to download the CLI.  

By default the CLI files will be placed next to the executable.  
If you'd rather have them elsewhere or already possess the CLI, you can press `No` and go into options to change what folder the CLI will be looked for in.
